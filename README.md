# TOPMODEL BMI

This model is development for use in the [NGen Water Modeling Framework Prototype](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). It include wrapper functions for the [Basic Model Interface](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  More BMI related refereces can be found [here](refs/csdms).
  
TOPMODEL is a physically based, distributed watershed model that simulates hydrologic fluxes of water (infiltration-excess overland flow, saturation overland flow, infiltration, exfiltration, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel routing) through a watershed. The model simulates explicit groundwater/surface water interactions by predicting the movement of the water table, which determines where saturated land-surface areas develop and have the potential to produce saturation overland flow. TOPMODEL was originally developed by [Beven & Kirby (1979)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02626667909491834).
